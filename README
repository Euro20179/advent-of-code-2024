───────────────────────────────────── Aoc ─────────────────────────────────────

I wanted try doing aoc in viml this year because viml is fun.
And you can do some crazy stuff,

I've devised a poing system to encourage the use of text editing commands
as apposed to just using basic functions and for loops

== Challenge

    The challenge will be to do it in as few readable lines as possible.
    a "readable line" is a line that is < 80 chars.
    Line
        \\ continutations, count as 2 lines

== Point system

    For every line subtract 1 point
    For every ex command that exists [here] | https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/vip/Ex-Command-Reference.html |
        Add 1 point
        Using an old ex command in a non-old ex command does not count
            eg: `execute p`
        using an old ex command within an old ex command counts as 1 point
            eg: `g/hi/p`

    for each range/address used add 1 point
        eg: `2,3s/a/b/`
        eg: `%s/a/b/`
